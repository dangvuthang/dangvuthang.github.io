          <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            My teammate Thang has provided me with some useful feedback
            regarding my project idea. He told me that my idea is good, and I
            should add features like recommended courses so that students will
            have an easier time searching for what they wanted to learn. He also
            pointed out that since the content of each lecture is up to the
            teacher to decide, I should let them change the content during the
            middle of the course so that they can cater to the specific need of
            each group of students. Thus, setting my application apart from
            other platforms since their system required the content to be
            decided up ahead and stick to that till the end. I agree with his
            idea because it is a unique feature that I believe no other
            platforms have. By implementing this, I will allow the flexibility
            that both teachers and students need during their time studying
            together. Chi and Linh also offer some advice when hearing my idea.
            At first, I intend to let the price of the whole course be decided
            by the teacher instead of the weekly/ monthly/ yearly I mentioned in
            the project idea section. However, they mentioned that doing so may
            discourage students to enroll in the course because they do not know
            the quality that the course offer. If they did enroll but turned out
            bored by the lecture, they might waste a lot of money investing in
            the course. Even worse, they may stop using the application. As a
            result, I decided that there should be a trial period for students
            to check whether this course is right for them, and the fee for any
            courses will be paid weekly/ monthly/ yearly instead of the full
            price. Thank my teammatesâ€™ feedback, I now have a better view of
            what my product should be like, which lead me to build a better
            version of this idea. I am grateful to them for not only patient
            enough to listen to my project idea for a whole hour but provide me
            some insight from the perspective of a consumer.
