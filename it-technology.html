          Since I enjoy web development. I going to describe the two pieces of
          technology that have helped tremendously for web developers, and I
          also may integrate them with my own idea project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first one I am going to describe is the upcoming trend of BaaS
          which stands for backend as a service, or some may realize the term
          serverless. In the past, to build a large-scale application, you need
          a backend application to build a web server or exposing API as an
          endpoint for clients to request. However, with services like Firebase
          backed by Google, or AWS Amplify, 8Base, they are packed with all the
          features you may need for the backend application. No longer do you
          have to manually build the authentication system to check login, these
          services already offer social login. Not only are they more secure,
          but they also abstract developers from wasting too much time to
          implement them. Thus, allowing them to focus on the business logic of
          the application. Besides, BaaS already comes with very exciting
          features like cloud storage, real-time database, and hosting
          solutions, which would take a lot of time and effort to build from
          scratch. Scalability may be something that backend developers may
          forget when building their application, but with BaaS, they do not
          have to worry about this matter as the application is automatically
          scaled according to their needs. It is also said that some BaaS also
          offer machine learning capabilities to enhance their application UX.
          For example, because Firebase is backed by Google, it used Google
          Cloud computing to provide great features like labeling images,
          recognizing text, and recognizing landmarks for machine learning. As a
          result of BaaS, it is now so much easier to transition from the
          frontend developers to full-stack developers. I believe for the
          upcoming year; it is possible that developers do not have to think
          about their backend as all and focus their time and energy on solving
          the real problem. This BaaS is made possible due to the growth of
          cloud computing. BaaS has a huge impact on both developers, and small
          businesses as well. Companies do not have to worry about hiring
          backend teams to build servers, which would reduce the overall cost.
          They do not have to worry about scaling up their backend
          infrastructure to meet the demand of their user. The most important
          aspect is that they will be able to test their application as soon as
          possible to know whether some improvements will be needed for the
          frontend. Developers will have an easier time integrating their work
          with BaaS and do not have to worry about the security and database
          management aspect. This is not to say that backend developers will be
          jobless; as a matter of fact, great technologies only abstract you
          from the coding part. Companies still need them to maintain and
          configure according to each specific use case. For me, I believe BaaS
          will help me a lot when I try to build a project to demo during my
          time studying at RMIT. I can now focus my time and energy to make
          beautiful UI and build my application logic without worrying too much
          about the backend server.

          Another technology that has been emerged on the website is the natural
          processing language. It is about giving a computer the ability to
          understand the speech of a human. To see this technology in action,
          you can simply use your smartphone whether it is Android or IOS. For
          Android, if you say, “OK Google”, you will notice the popup showing up
          that offers assistance, then just say whatever you need. You can find
          this technology also on the website. For example, going to the TpBank
          website, you will see that the chatbot will help to answer some
          questions you may have. Instead of wasting time in the FAQ section,
          the chatbot will answer all common questions you may have. Maybe after
          3 years, natural processing language will be able to understand any
          languages in the world. As a result, instead of the traditional input
          like keyboard, mouse, the computer can be instructed by human’s speech
          alone with high accuracy. NPL is made possible due to machine learning
          algorithms. NPL has a huge potential considered the benefit it brings.
          We may longer require human assistance in some common tasks like
          providing guidance, feedback with the help of the expert system.
          Customer service jobs might be the most affected by NPL, and all these
          jobs may be lost due to the rise of NPL. However, with the current
          level of NPL level, it is still far from accomplishing it. We
          sometimes still value what other human being said than the machine. As
          a developer, hopefully in the future, instead of coding on the
          keyboard, which would lead to some serious health problems like carpal
          tunnel, I can just tell the computer instead of through speech
          recognition. However, it would take a long time for NPL to reach that
          level. For now, in my daily life, I can just use Google Assistant to
          remind me about my upcoming schedule, or when is my deadline for an
          assignment.
