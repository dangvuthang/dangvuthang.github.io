          <h2>Overview of Git and GitHub</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you read the documentation in Git page, it will state that Git is a
          version control system. However, what exactly is a version control
          system anyway? To put it simple, it is a software that records your
          work overtime. Take the Facebook Messenger for example, whatever you
          typed with your friend is being saved so that whenever you need to
          view back your message, you can easily do so just by scrolling the bar
          up. Git is similar in that sense that it allowed you to view back on
          your work if needed. Another great thing about Git is its ability to
          monitor your work and find out which part has changed comparing to the
          previous version. As a result, you can compare your current work with
          the previous one to see what has changed. Doing so help you a lot when
          it comes to deciding whether these changes are good, or should you
          drop all of it and return to the last version. While Git is great with
          these features alone, it can only run locally on your machine. Thus,
          you can only view your work on your own machine. With GitHub, the
          problem is solved. GitHub is a service that allow you to push your
          work on its server so that you can access it on any machines to
          continue your work. Besides, since your work is already on the cloud,
          you can invite your teammates to work together on your project. Other
          people can contribute to your work by raising issues for you to fix or
          making a pull request to add another feature to your work.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The reason why you should use Git and GitHub, especially if you are
          the developer, is as follow. Firstly, it helps you and your teammates
          to work more efficiently because it is a centralized place where all
          your works are located. In the past, if you want to work with someone,
          you will have to copy their work on your own machine and continue
          working there. Not only is it ineffective, but it would become a
          tedious task in the long run since you have to keep track with each
          other work to make sure what you are currently working on does not
          conflict with them. If conflict did happen, you would have to manually
          detect where it is and discuss among yourselves to deal with it. Doing
          these tasks manually would take too much out of your time and keep you
          away from your real work. With Git and GitHub, everything is
          automatically done so you can stay on track with your work. Another
          great thing of Git and GitHub is that it can boost your career
          prospects. Since all your works are put into the cloud, and your
          contribution can be seen by anyone, it is much easier for any
          potential recruiters to take notice of you and your skill set instead
          of the conventional which you have to seek a job by yourself. There
          have been many cases where big company like Facebook, Google, or
          Amazon directly contact an individual whose contribution has helped
          solved their problem, and ultimately, they are hired by these
          companies. Git and GitHub is a great place where you can show off your
          skill and idea.

          Install Git is very straightforward. It is exactly like how you
          install a game on your machine. Firstly, visit this website

          Scroll down then you will see the section that will detect your
          operation system and recommend the download option for you. After the
          download completed, you can open the application and finish the
          installation process. To check if your computer has successfully
          installed Git. You need to do:

              </li>
              <li>
                When you are in the command prompt, type this command “git
                version” or “git --version”. If you see any results, it means
                you has successfully installed Git

          What about GitHub? Because GitHub is a service that allowed you to
          push your work online. You need to register an account with GitHub to
          start using it. Go to
          <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> and register an
          account. After that you can start using Git and GitHub.

          Before learning Git, we should set up our identity so that Git and
          GitHub know who we are. This will become important when we start to
          push our work to GitHub.

          “git config --list” will show you all the global value of your git
          configuration.

        <p>
          It may seem daunting at first, but we will only focus on 2 value which
          is “user.name” and “user.email”. Because I have already configured my
          git, the value is already there. To set them up just simple type “git
          config --global user.email “your value”” and “git config --global
          user.name “your value””
        </p>
        After this, if you check “git config --list” will show you the value
        that you just entered in those fields.

          We now have a solid understanding of Git and GitHub. It is time to
          learn to use it. The first thing we need to learn is how to create a
          Git project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first command you will learn is “git init” to initialize the Git
          project.
        </p>

        <ol class="pl-3">
          <li>Create an empty folder on your desktop</li>
          <li>
            Open that newly created folder with your favorite IDE, it is
            recommended that you use Visual Studio Code since it has an
            integrated terminal which we can you directly use without having to
            open the terminal. You can download it here
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Link</a>

        </div>
        <p class="mt-3 mb-3">
          As you can see, I am in a new folder with no files at all.

        <div>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/guide/Picture2.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3">Open the integrated terminal by pressing Ctrl + `.</p>
        <p>
          Then type “git init” in the command line. You will see the message as
          follow:
        </p>
        <div>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/guide/Picture3.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3">
          If you see no message or some errors occur, it means you have not
          installed Git correctly. Refer to How to install Git and GitHub.
          Otherwise you have successfully made your folder a new Git repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that our folder is being monitored by Git, you can start using the
          upcoming command.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, create a new file in your current Git repository folder. In the
          example below, I created a new text.txt file and add some content to
          it. You can create any kind of files and Git will still be able to
          work with them.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/guide/Picture4.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3 mb-3">
          I believe the most important command when working with Git locally is
          “git status” as it shows you the state of your folder and what you
          should do.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/guide/Picture5.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3">
          It is very useful command as it shows you what you should do next. The
          message means Git knows that you have a new file named text.txt and it
          would like to track your file. It also includes the next command that
          we will learn, which is “git add”.
        </p>
        <p>
          “git add” is a way that we tell Git to start tracking our file or make
          change to the file that Git already monitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the command “git add” you should include the name of the file
          that you want to keep track, or the “.” to include all the file.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <img src="assets/img/guide/Picture6.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
            <span class="font-italic font-weight-light mt-1 d-block"

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3 mb-3">
          Next, let us try “git status” and see what Git will tell us next.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/img/guide/Picture8.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3">
          You will notice the message “Changed to be committed” and a command
          for you to tell Git to stop tracking the file that you just created,
          which is "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;". At this stage, if you are
          satisfied with your work, you can tell Git to save, record your work
          by typing “git commit”.
        </p>
        <p>
          “git commit” let you save your current working directory after what
          you have previously added with “git add”. The syntax is as “git commit
          -m “the message you want””. For example
        </p>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/img/guide/Picture9.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3 mb-3">
          I let Git save my work with the message “Initial commit”. To check
          your Git commit timestamp use “git log”. It will log out all your
          commit up to now.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/img/guide/Picture10.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3 mb-3">
          If you make any changes to the files, and type “git status”
        </p>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/img/guide/Picture11.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
        </div>
        <p class="mt-3 mb-3">
          Git will tell you to either use “git add &lt;file&gt;” again to save
          the new changes, or use “git restore &lt;file&gt;” to discard those
          changes and return to the previous version that you have committed. If
          you are happy with the work, use “git add” again to tell Git to save
          those changes. Then use “git commit” to record your file again. That
          is basically the lifecycle of Git.

          To publish your work for the world to see, you need to use GitHub. If

          GitHub.

        <p class="mb-3">

        <p class="mb-3">
          GitHub allows you to collaborate with other people so it is likely
          that conflicts will happen when you are working on the same project.
          However, Git and GitHub are very smart tool that help you to resolve
          those easily. To replicate the problem, I am going to use another
          account to simulate the situation when working together as a group.

          Take this case for example, you and your teammates work on a project
          together. You do your work on your own local machine, and they do on
          theirs. However, when you take a break, and stop working that does not
          necessarily mean that theirs is finished. After an hour of coding,
          they decided to push all their work to GitHub. Later that day, you
          also complete your task and decide to push your work to the cloud.
          Then, you realized that you cannot push your work at all. There is a
          conflict between you and your teammates work. You need to resolve it.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3 mb-3">
          I open two folder that is both derived from the remote git repository
          above. The two folders with the same text.txt file, but it has
          different content to simulate the conflict. If I add these changes,
          commit, then push the left one to the cloud first, it will work fine.
          After this, if I try to work on the left one, make changes then commit
          and push, it will not work.
        </p>
        <div>

        <p class="mt-3">
          It is because GitHub detects that what you are trying to push does not
          match the latest code on the remote server so it is complaining that
          we should get the latest code then try again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading the instruction is very clear. First, we should pull the
          latest code from the server, use “git pull” again. After doing so, you
          will notice that Git detect conflict between what you have on line 4
          and what the server currently has. It asks you to take 1 of the 3
          actions, which are to accept current change, incoming change from the
          server, or accept both changes. It is now up to you to decide what is
          the best option here.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Since I want to keep both changes, I will choose the first option.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          After that if I do the usual add -&gt; commit -&gt; push, it will work
          again.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3">
          That is basically how you deal with conflicts when working with other
          people.
