          <h2>IT Work</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          For this section, I was lucky enough to have an interview with an IT
          professional. His name is Tung, and he is my brother-in-law. He is a
          full-stack software engineer at BodiData company, which is a fashion
          tech company that uses computer vision to visualize the three sizes of
          a human body to suggest the perfect size clothes for the user. Since
          his position required him to work on both the frontend and backend, he
          provides me with a very high-level overview of what his job usually
          involves. He usually has an interview with an end-user to discuss the
          project, then depend on the outcome, he may have to come up with a
          wireframe for it. After that, he will meet up with his stakeholder to
          design the workflow process. When everything is ready, he will start
          to design UI/UX for the product, then start building UI with React.
          When the frontend is ready, he will work on the backend to create an
          API and connect it with the frontend application. After numerous
          testing, it will come to the deployment phase. This comes to me as a
          surprise since I do not think an IT professionals’ job consists of
          many tasks. Before this, I only think IT professionals mostly do
          coding, but he told me that communication is of great importance when
          you want are a developer. Not only do you need to interact with other
          colleagues to discuss work-related matters such as seeking/giving
          advice, doing code review, or requesting access to some resources, but
          you also need to speak with the sale team to gather clients’ need or
          discuss the vision and progress with your CEO. While coding is the
          main task of any developer, he said that you would only spend about
          50% of your time to code while the other 50% consists of discussions,
          team building, and the most important thing is self-study to keep
          yourself up to date with the latest technology. After discussing with
          him, I believe the most challenging aspect of the IT professional is
          the ability to understand the real problems behind end-users. We need
          to distinguish between what the user wants and what the user needs. He
          also shares with me what he thought was the essence of the IT
          industry, “In contrast to conventional belief, the most essential
          activity is not writing code, but problem-detection and
          problem-solving”.
