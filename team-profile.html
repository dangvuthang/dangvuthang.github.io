          <h2>Team Profile</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Before week 8, I was able to assemble other members to form a team.
          Our team consists of 4 members, which are Nhi, Thang, Chi, and me
          whose name is also Thang. Since my team does not seem to be very
          creative when it comes to naming things, we just name our team
          according to the first letter of everyone’s name. Thus, our team’s
          name is TTNC. While it is not the best name for the team, I believe it
          has a nice ring to it and easy to remember.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Although our team is mostly made up of introverted individuals, I
          believe our team composition is very good. For Nhi, she may not be
          familiar with coding, but she is experienced with designing UI/UX. She
          can contribute to building the UI for our final project. Thang may not
          major in IT; however, with his knowledge coming from the Digital
          Marketing field, he was able to offer many pieces of advice regarding
          our idea. His advice helps us to identify whether our idea is
          practical for the end-user and should we go along with it. Thanks to
          his advice, we were able to quickly brainstorm many great ideas and
          avoid wasting too much time on impractical ones. Chi is the only
          extroverted member in our group. I have not had many chances to speak
          to her since she studied in another tutorial section. Nonetheless, due
          to her friendly attitude, she creates an approachable image that helps
          other teammates to open to each other since we are very timid to start
          a conversation on our own. You could say that she keeps our team
          connected and thus improve our teamwork. Lastly, there is me. As I
          already have 2 years of experience coding, I also offer some technical
          advice when my teammates need it. I believe I will also be the main
          coder for my whole team. As you can see from all my team members, they
          have their strengths and weakness, but together we can compensate for
          each other to make the final project work. Even if they do not know
          how to code, they can contribute to the project in their way. Thang
          has suggested many brilliant ideas while Nhi has started to build the
          general UI so that we can use it for the final project. Chi is also
          learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript to support me for the final
          project. With amazing teammates like this, I believe we can finish the
          project on time.
