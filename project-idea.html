            The project that I have been wanting to do for a long time is a
            virtual classroom. It is a web application that represents a
            classroom. In this application, instead of going to school, students
            or anyone wishing to learn new skills can use this website to study
            anything they want anywhere. Likewise, anyone who is a teacher, or
            is a professional in a particular field can sign up to share their
            experience and teach other people.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2 mb-2">
            You can argue that we have already had applications like Google
            Meet, Microsoft Teams for video conferencing, or if you want to
            study new things, Udemy will be a famous platform. However, these
            tools have their limitation when it comes to organizing lectures
            because Google Meet and Microsoft Team is more for business meetings
            than for studying. While Udemy is primarily online courses that the
            teachers record before then upload, the only interaction that
            teachers and students have is through the question section. This
            application can be thought of as a combination of both platforms
            mentioning above. Besides, the COVID-19 has proved that we need
            another form of learning where teachers and students can interact as
            in a traditional classroom in case something like this may happen in
            the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the main website, the application must have authentication
            features such as login, logout, and signup. I may implement login
            with other platforms such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft,
            to ease the process of building the backend server. Students should
            be notified about the upcoming classes, assignments, … Thus, the
            application should send an email to inform everyone about new
            notifications. Because there are many courses available, the
            application will have a search input for users to look for a
            specific course. Not only that, but there will also be features like
            filters, sort according to specific criteria that the user required.
            In addition to the course and lecturer’s description, there will
            also be a feedback, comment section to provide other users with the
            experience that the course offers. As students also need to view
            their schedule for the week, month, and year, the application will
            have a timetable system of its own. For teachers, they can create a
            new course and set the start date to inform other users about the
            upcoming class of their own. There will be a period when students
            have a chance to enroll free of charge to see whether this course or
            this style of teaching by the teacher is suitable for them. After
            that, if they wish to continue with their studies, they need to pay
            an amount of money required by the course per week/month/year. The
            beauty of this approach is that the teacher should estimate
            appropriately what the content of their course worth, and for the
            students, they can pay as they go meaning if they do not wish to
            continue learning, they can drop out at any time and save their
            money. Since the content of the lecture is delivered through
            real-time interaction with teachers, the content of it will up to
            date. Unlike platforms like Udemy which you will find content that
            will only be relevant at the time of recording. The most important
            of this application is its ability to stream data in real-time on
            the website for any lectures. When the teacher is ready, they will
            start the lecture, then the email will be sent to every student to
            inform everyone who following the course (the lecture time is
            available through the course description, doing this is to ensure
            that everyone will be able to join automatically without manual
            login like other applications). The link will take the students
            directly to the website; however, as a convention, they will be
            asked to allow the microphone, and a webcam to continue. The video
            will have other advanced features like virtual background,
            breakroom, and other configurations that you will see on any
            video-conferencing application. Of course, the video and all the
            materials that the teachers will become available for students to
            download if they wish to. Another great feature I could think of is
            the ability to monitor each student’s attention, there will be a
            tool to monitor whether the students are on the tab focusing on
            studying, or they just keep the application on while browsing the
            internet doing something else. That is all the features I could
            think of as of now.

            Since this is a web application, I believe no further hardware is
            required. All you need is a computer capable of running a web
            browser and an internet connection. However, the software skills
            required for this application is quite challenging. As this is a web
            application, HTML, CSS, JavaScript is the most fundamental skills
            that one needs for the frontend application. To establish a
            connection with the frontend application and start streaming video
            to clients, the backend server is also needed. For the clients to
            receive data and show it to the user, WebTRC API is something I will
            have to learn to implement this functionality. I may also want to
            implement the real-time update, meaning whenever the data on the
            backend is changed or created, I want it to broadcast its change to
            all clients that are connecting to it. This functionality also
            required another API, which is called WebSocket. I believe all these
            skills are not that hard to come by. You may need some knowledge
            regarding the mentioned API to make it work; however, nowadays,
            there are already thousands of libraries, packages that are very
            easy to use without too much effort to learn.
          </p>

            If the project succeeds, students will have more platforms to learn
            from. They can learn whatever they want to learn, or further develop
            their skills through the help of the teacher or professional in the
            field of their choice. As I have stated in the first paragraph, with
            the help of this application, students can learn anything anywhere.
            For those who are teachers, or professionals, they have an
            opportunity to share their skills, experience with everyone around
            the world, no longer do they have to worry about the distance
            between them and the students. Thanks to this application, students
            are exposed to a wide range of education online. Thus, allowing them
            to choose the best form of teaching style that is suitable for them.
